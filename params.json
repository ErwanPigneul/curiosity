If the user adds a field, it is then available for being displayed or facetted !\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nThe elasticsearch documents should have been indexed with a mapping that makes \"full-text\" search available on every fields.\r\nBefore indexing your data, you may set this generic mapping (replacing INDEX_NAME by your own index, and DOC_NAME by the doc type you are adressing) :\r\n\r\n`curl -XPUT 'ES_SERVER:PORT/INDEX_NAME/_mapping' -d '{\r\n    \"DOC_NAME\" : {\r\n        \"dynamic_templates\" : [\r\n            {\r\n                \"facette_template\" : {\r\n                    \"match\" : \"*\",\r\n                    \"match_mapping_type\" : \"string\",\r\n                    \"mapping\" : {\r\n                        \"type\" : \"multi_field\",\r\n                        \"fields\" : {\r\n                            \"{name}_fulltext\" : {\"type\": \"string\", \"index\" : \"analyzed\"},\r\n                            \"{name}\" : {\"type\": \"string\", \"index\" : \"not_analyzed\"}\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n}'`\r\n\r\nEvery field will be indexed for \"full-text\" search AND facetting. \r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\nNo demo available yet.\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\nThis version is not usable yet : for testing the concept, run the prototype tool (curiosityPoc on github).\r\n\r\nMVC refactoring with angularjs.\r\n\r\n## Copyright and License\r\n\r\n    Curiosity - BigData Explorer\r\n    Copyright (C) 2013  Fabrice Depaulis for PagesJaunes\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
