Curiosity hasn't external dependency. There is nothing to install. You just have to clone git repository or uncompress the archive where you want. 
Then you have to modify few values in conf.js located at the folder root.

* "defaultServer" : The default server where curiosity will work

* "confServer" : The server where curiosity will store his data (keywords, context, template, ...)

* "confIndex" : The index in confServer where curiosity will store his data

After that, open index.html. Wait a moment (about 5 or 10 seconde) untill curiosity initialize his data then reload the page. You are now ready to use curiosity.
